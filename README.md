# Spring Security JWT

If you perform a quick search on how to secure your REST APIs in Spring Boot using JSON Web Tokens you will find a lot of the same results. These results contain a method that involves writing a custom filter chain and pulling in a 3rd party library for encoding and decoding JWTs.

I knew there had to be an easier way so I did what anyone with direct access to the Spring Security team would do, I asked them for help. They informed me that indeed Spring Security has built-in support for JWTs using oAuth2 Resource Server.

In this tutorial you are going to learn how to secure your APIs using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with Spring Security. Iâ€™m not saying this approach is easy by any stretch but for me it made a lot more sense than the alternatives.
